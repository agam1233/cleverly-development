Cleverly TOS
This is an AI called cleverly, it is open-source and I allow people to take the code and experiment with it.
I am not responsible for any bad things which happen with cleverly
I have been planning to make it free, and it is very easy because I don't need a data center because I could rely on other servers.
I have also made it opensource because it is an ollama model already have built in saftey features and restrictions.
well actually make sure to tell me if you have any ideas
rules:
dont distrubite illegaily
dont steal it
dont replace it with a uncensored model
Most of the AI was coded with ai.
